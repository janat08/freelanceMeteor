todo:
yourbid once invited doesn't work, on project, the accept button doesnt show
profit and loss isn't reactive, if accepting create request from manage transactions
transactions are duplicated if accepting request via manage transactions section

backlog:
create milestones during the bid, test that bids are updated to bidding true, use function for retrieving all form values or track keyup to update reactiveVar for user's corrections
test create milestone on bid

//////////////////////////
theres no overflow auto in chat
use createDirectMessage with others username, generate random username on freelancer side
or preserve settings route; enable video conference under settings from the start
change direct messages label (i18) in sidenav.html
the action bar at the top wont show embedded
upload file area doesn't work- deleted-, and styles break because the text messages expand container outside parent
room message box isn't in mobile mode
///////////////////////////

done:
fix milestones finances accounting for canceled milestones, and grouping milestones, without username, show actions at inappropriate states (went for performance optimized code, and then forgot what I was doing)
finances actions are weird
remove your bid section when boss looks at the project
fix payments accordion in profit/loss
fix time filters for profit/loss
sort milestones by date in finances
test profit/loss filter
test project filters (fix hashtag bug)
test profile
test create project
test profit/loss
test project milestones



defects:
freelancers/bosses projects can't be found
////////////////////////////////


notes:
hashtag search is exclusive (searching by 1, and 2, will exclude projects with just the 1 or the 2)
////////////////////////////////
if a lot of messages are in chat, then it will ignore fixed height, and begin overflowing
consider using condensed view by default
styles are broken
you must do /setup-wizard/ and then enable video conferencing and (sidebar nav in admin settings won't work) open in new tab in admin settings under /admin/Video%2520Conference
milestones details not shown in financial dash
milestones when bidding
comission employee not done
milestone requests in financial dash not included,
the transactions terribly wrong state fix isnt applied, since the docs don't describe well enough detection process.
