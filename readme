todo:

done:
fix milestones finances accounting for canceled milestones, and grouping milestones, without username, show actions at inappropriate states (went for performance optimized code, and then forgot what I was doing)
finances actions are weird
remove your bid section when boss looks at the project, or if empty
fix payments accordion in profit/loss
fix time filters for profit/loss
sort milestones by date in finances
test profit/loss filter
test project filters (fix hashtag bug)
test profile
test create project
test profit/loss
test project milestones
transactions are duplicated if accepting request via manage transactions section (because parent event handler catches the event, although I specifically know that it shouldn't happen)
milestone cancelation now counts againsts payments made in finances (creating and then canceling results in 0)
fixed yourbid section
freelancers/bosses projects in which they're already participating can't be found directly
create milestones during the bid
make milestones visible through price link
defects:
profit and loss isn't reactive, although I stuck reactive dependencies everywhere I could, and invoked tracker every which way
test create milestone on bid
navbar js, won't close on select


notes:
hashtag search is exclusive (searching by 1, and 2, will exclude projects with just the 1 or the 2)
let milestones be created before project acceptance, on invite, and canceled after 3 days, this isn't strictly required as comission is taken on milestone release, rather than on project acceptance

////////////////////////////////
if a lot of messages are in chat, then it will ignore fixed height, and begin overflowing
consider using condensed view by default
styles are broken
you must do /setup-wizard/ and then enable video conferencing and (sidebar nav in admin settings won't work) open in new tab in admin settings under /admin/Video%2520Conference
milestones details not shown in financial dash
milestones when bidding
comission employee not done
milestone requests in financial dash not included,
the transactions terribly wrong state fix isnt applied, since the docs don't describe well enough detection process.
room.js is under /app/ui/client/views/app

//////////////////////////
theres no overflow auto in chat
use createDirectMessage with others username, generate random username on freelancer side
or preserve settings route; enable video conference under settings from the start
change direct messages label (i18) in sidenav.html
the action bar at the top wont show embedded
upload file area doesn't work- deleted-, and styles break because the text messages expand container outside parent
room message box isn't in mobile mode
